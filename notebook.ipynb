    "# Project: \"Pothole Hunter\" – My First YOLO Training from A to Z\n",
    "\n",
    "Hi\\! In this notebook, I want to tell the story of my first complete object detection project. The goal wasn't just to train a model, but to learn the *entire* process: from finding raw data, through the tedious task of labeling, all the way to training in the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project:** Pothole Detection.\n",
    "**Model:** I used the YOLO architecture (in this example, I'll show it using **YOLOv8s** – a small, fast variant).\n",
    "**Tools:** Kaggle (data), Label Studio (labeling), Google Colab (training).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1: The Data Story (The Problem and the Raw Material)\n",
    "\n",
    "Every AI project begins with data. My goal was simple: I wanted a model to learn how to recognize potholes on roads. It's a problem everyone is familiar with, and automating it could genuinely help road maintenance crews.\n",
    "\n",
    "I didn't want to take a shortcut by using a pre-labeled dataset. I wanted to experience the process myself.\n",
    "\n",
    "I found the perfect raw material on Kaggle: **Pothole Image Segmentation Dataset**.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Link:** [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/farzadnekouei/pothole-image-segmentation-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/farzadnekouei/pothole-image-segmentation-dataset)\n",
    "\n",
    "It was ideal because it contained hundreds of raw images of potholes... but **without the object detection labels** (bounding boxes) that I needed for YOLO. I had the pictures, but the model had no idea *where* the potholes were in them.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2: The Real Work (Labeling in Label Studio)\n",
    "\n",
    "This was the moment I understood what machine learning is all about. **Training the model is fast. Preparing the data is 90% of the work.**\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose **Label Studio** as my tool. It's a powerful, free platform for data labeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**My process (storytelling):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Install and Setup:** I installed Label Studio locally.\n",
    "2.  **Import Data:** I set up a new project and imported several hundred pothole images from the downloaded Kaggle dataset.\n",
    "3.  **Define the Class:** I defined one, simple class: `pothole`.\n",
    "4.  **The Tedious Drawing:** And then, it began. Image by image, pothole by pothole. I opened an image and manually drew a rectangle (bounding box) around every visible pothole.\n",
    "\n",
    "After spending several hours on this, Label Studio allowed me to export the fruits of my labor. I chose the **YOLO** format. I received a `labels` folder full of `.txt` files – one for each image, containing the coordinates of the boxes I had drawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 3: The Colab Workshop (Environment Setup)\n",
    "\n",
    "With my data ready (images + labels), I was ready to train. I moved to Google Colab to use its free GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "First step: install `ultralytics`, the library that makes working with YOLOv8 incredibly simple.\n"

    "  * **Conclusion 2 (The Most Important One):** **\"Garbage In, Garbage Out.\"** The model's quality is directly linked to the quality of the labels. The hours spent in Label Studio were more important than the training code itself. I understood why \"Data Labeling\" is a massive industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "I went through the entire pipeline: from a raw photo, through manually drawing boxes, to a working AI model. It was an incredible experience\\!"
